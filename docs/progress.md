## 2025-09-01 Session 2 - Sentry Integration

### Completed
- [x] Added Sentry error tracking integration
- [x] Created config package with tests (TDD approach)
  - [x] Test: TestLoadConfig_Defaults (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestLoadConfig_FromEnvironment (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestConfig_IsSentryEnabled (passing)
- [x] Integrated Sentry middleware in main.go
- [x] Updated handlers to capture events to Sentry
- [x] Added test endpoint for Sentry verification
- [x] All existing tests still passing (9/9)

### Sentry Features Implemented
- Automatic error capture with stack traces
- Request context attached to errors
- Sensitive data filtering (headers, cookies)
- Info-level tracking for successful orders
- Warning-level tracking for validation errors
- Environment-based configuration (debug/release)
- Graceful degradation if Sentry unavailable

## 2025-09-01 Session 1 - Initial Backend Setup

### Completed
- [x] Created project structure for walmart-monarch-backend
- [x] Initialized Go module with dependencies
- [x] Implemented TDD workflow for health check endpoint
  - [x] Test: TestHealthCheck (written first, failed, then passed)
- [x] Implemented TDD workflow for Walmart order receive endpoint
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_Success (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_InvalidJSON (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_MissingAuth (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_EmptyOrder (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_InvalidOrderTotal (passing)
- [x] Created models package with Order and OrderResponse structs
- [x] Implemented authentication middleware
- [x] All tests passing (6/6)

### In Progress
- [ ] Creating documentation files
- [ ] Setting up main.go server
- [ ] Creating supporting files (.env.example, .gitignore, sample data)

### Next Steps
1. Complete main.go implementation
2. Add Monarch Money SDK integration (currently blocked - package not available)
3. Implement order processing service
4. Add transaction matching logic
5. Create integration tests
6. Add Docker support

### Test Coverage
- handlers package: 100% coverage for implemented features
- All tests follow TDD methodology (test first, fail, implement, pass)

### Notes for Next Session
- **Important**: The monarchmoney-go SDK (github.com/eshaffer321/monarchmoney-go or github.com/erickshaffer/monarchmoney-go) appears to be a private repository or not yet published. Will need to either:
  1. Get access to the SDK repository
  2. Create a mock implementation for testing
  3. Build a minimal SDK implementation
- Health check endpoint working at GET /health
- Walmart order receive endpoint working at POST /api/walmart/orders
- Authentication using X-Extension-Key header
- Using Gin framework for HTTP server
- All handlers have comprehensive test coverage

### TDD Methodology Followed
1. ✅ Wrote TestHealthCheck first → Watched it fail → Implemented → Passed
2. ✅ Wrote all Walmart order tests first → Watched them fail → Implemented → All passed
3. ✅ No code written without tests first
4. ✅ All tests currently passing
