# Progress Tracking - Walmart-Monarch Sync Backend

## 2025-09-03 Session - Order Handling Updates (TDD)

### Completed
- [x] Merged PR #3 (fix-gitignore) to main
- [x] Created new feature branch: feat/update-order-handling
- [x] Updated Order model to match Chrome extension structure (TDD):
  - [x] Tests written first: TestOrder_Unmarshal_* (6 tests, all passing)
  - [x] Made orderTotal optional (pointer type)
  - [x] Made items optional
  - [x] Added tax, deliveryCharges, tip fields (optional)
  - [x] Added productUrl to OrderItem
  - [x] All model tests passing (6/6)
- [x] Updated ReceiveOrders handler (TDD):
  - [x] Tests written first for relaxed validation (3 new tests)
  - [x] Removed orderTotal > 0 validation
  - [x] Removed requirement for at least one item
  - [x] Added handling for new optional fields
  - [x] Enhanced response with processingId, itemCount, totalAmount
  - [x] All handler tests passing (7/7)
- [x] Implemented batch orders endpoint (TDD):
  - [x] Tests written first: TestReceiveBatchOrders_* (5 tests, all passing)
  - [x] POST /api/walmart/orders/batch
  - [x] Processes multiple orders individually
  - [x] Returns detailed results per order
  - [x] Handles partial failures gracefully
- [x] Implemented sync status endpoint (TDD):
  - [x] Tests written first: TestGetSyncStatus_* (3 tests, all passing)
  - [x] GET /api/walmart/sync-status
  - [x] Tracks last sync timestamp
  - [x] Counts orders processed today and total
  - [x] Thread-safe implementation with sync.RWMutex
- [x] All tests passing (21 total tests across all packages)

### Test Coverage Summary
- models: 6 tests (all passing)
- handlers: 15 tests (all passing)
- config: 3 tests (all passing)
- **Total: 24 tests, 100% passing**

### TDD Process Followed
1. ✅ Wrote model tests first → Failed → Updated models → Passed
2. ✅ Wrote handler validation tests → Failed → Updated handler → Passed
3. ✅ Wrote batch endpoint tests → Failed → Implemented endpoint → Passed
4. ✅ Wrote sync status tests → Failed → Implemented endpoint → Passed
5. ✅ No production code written without failing test first

### API Endpoints Updated
- `POST /api/walmart/orders` - Now accepts optional fields
- `POST /api/walmart/orders/batch` - New batch processing endpoint
- `GET /api/walmart/sync-status` - New status monitoring endpoint

### Next Steps
1. Integration testing with Chrome extension
2. Add persistent storage for sync tracking
3. Implement Monarch Money SDK integration
4. Add rate limiting for batch operations
5. Create API documentation

### Notes for Next Session
- Sync tracker uses in-memory storage (will reset on restart)
- Consider adding Redis/database for persistent sync tracking
- Batch endpoint processes orders sequentially (consider parallel processing for performance)
- All new endpoints follow existing auth and error handling patterns

## 2025-09-01 Session 3 - Development Infrastructure

### Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive Makefile with 20+ commands
  - Development tools installation
  - Code formatting and quality checks
  - Testing with coverage reports
  - Build and release automation
  - Docker integration
  - CI/CD pipeline simulation
- [x] Added golangci-lint configuration
- [x] Created GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
  - Multi-Go version testing
  - Cross-platform builds
  - Security scanning
  - Docker image building
- [x] Added release automation workflow
  - Automatic binary builds for multiple platforms
  - Docker image publishing
  - GitHub release creation
- [x] Pre-commit hooks configuration
- [x] Docker support with multi-stage build
- [x] Hot reload development setup (air)

### Development Tools Available
```bash
make help              # View all 20+ available commands
make install-tools     # Install golangci-lint, goimports, air, gosec, etc.
make check            # Run fmt, vet, lint, test in one command
make coverage         # Generate HTML coverage reports (41.2% total)
make ci               # Simulate full CI pipeline locally
```

## 2025-09-01 Session 2 - Sentry Integration

### Completed
- [x] Added Sentry error tracking integration
- [x] Created config package with tests (TDD approach)
  - [x] Test: TestLoadConfig_Defaults (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestLoadConfig_FromEnvironment (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestConfig_IsSentryEnabled (passing)
- [x] Integrated Sentry middleware in main.go
- [x] Updated handlers to capture events to Sentry
- [x] Added test endpoint for Sentry verification
- [x] All existing tests still passing (9/9)

### Sentry Features Implemented
- Automatic error capture with stack traces
- Request context attached to errors
- Sensitive data filtering (headers, cookies)
- Info-level tracking for successful orders
- Warning-level tracking for validation errors
- Environment-based configuration (debug/release)
- Graceful degradation if Sentry unavailable

## 2025-09-01 Session 1 - Initial Backend Setup

### Completed
- [x] Created project structure for walmart-monarch-backend
- [x] Initialized Go module with dependencies
- [x] Implemented TDD workflow for health check endpoint
  - [x] Test: TestHealthCheck (written first, failed, then passed)
- [x] Implemented TDD workflow for Walmart order receive endpoint
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_Success (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_InvalidJSON (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_MissingAuth (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_EmptyOrder (passing)
  - [x] Test: TestReceiveOrders_InvalidOrderTotal (passing)
- [x] Created models package with Order and OrderResponse structs
- [x] Implemented authentication middleware
- [x] All tests passing (6/6)

### In Progress
- [ ] Creating documentation files
- [ ] Setting up main.go server
- [ ] Creating supporting files (.env.example, .gitignore, sample data)

### Next Steps
1. Complete main.go implementation
2. Add Monarch Money SDK integration (currently blocked - package not available)
3. Implement order processing service
4. Add transaction matching logic
5. Create integration tests
6. Add Docker support

### Test Coverage
- handlers package: 100% coverage for implemented features
- All tests follow TDD methodology (test first, fail, implement, pass)

### Notes for Next Session
- **Important**: The monarchmoney-go SDK (github.com/eshaffer321/monarchmoney-go or github.com/erickshaffer/monarchmoney-go) appears to be a private repository or not yet published. Will need to either:
  1. Get access to the SDK repository
  2. Create a mock implementation for testing
  3. Build a minimal SDK implementation
- Health check endpoint working at GET /health
- Walmart order receive endpoint working at POST /api/walmart/orders
- Authentication using X-Extension-Key header
- Using Gin framework for HTTP server
- All handlers have comprehensive test coverage

### TDD Methodology Followed
1. ✅ Wrote TestHealthCheck first → Watched it fail → Implemented → Passed
2. ✅ Wrote all Walmart order tests first → Watched them fail → Implemented → All passed
3. ✅ No code written without tests first
4. ✅ All tests currently passing
